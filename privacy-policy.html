<p>Quarter ehf. (“us”, “we”, or “our”) operates the http://startupresources.io/

<p>This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use and
disclosure of Personal Information when you use our Service.</p>

<p>We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in
this Privacy Policy.</p>

<p><strong>We use your Personal Information for providing and improving the
Service. By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use of
information in accordance with this policy.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Quarter ehf. is committed to complying with the EU’s <a
href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/en/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32016R0679">General
Data Protection Regulation</a></strong> and is already mostly compliant. You can
read more about our policies and how to exercise your rights under the GDPR by
reading our <a href="/data-protection">Data Protection Statement</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Information Collection And Use</strong></p>

<p>While using our Service, we may ask you to provide us with certain personally
identifiable information that can be used to contact or identify you. Personally
identifiable information may include, but is not limited to, your email address,
name, other information (“Personal Information”).</p>

<p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>

<p>Our web servers collect information that your browser sends whenever you
visit our Service (“Log Data”). This Log Data may include information such as
your computer’s Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, browser type, browser version,
the pages of our Service that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the
time spent on those pages and other statistics.</p>

<p>In addition, we may use third party services such as Google Analytics that
collect, monitor and analyze this type of information in order to increase our
Service’s functionality. These third party service providers have their own
privacy policies addressing how they use such information.</p>

<p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>

<p>Cookies are files with small amount of data, which may include an anonymous
unique identifier. Cookies are sent to your browser from a web site and stored
on your computer’s hard drive.</p>

<p>We use “cookies” to collect information. You can instruct your browser to
refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, if you
do not accept cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of our
Service.</p>

<p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>

<p>We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our
Service, to provide the Service on our behalf, to perform Service-related
services or to assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</p>

<p>These third parties have access to your Personal Information only to perform
these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any
other purpose.</p>

<p><strong>Communications</strong></p>

<p>We may use your Personal Information to contact you with newsletters,
marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest
to you. You may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from
us by following the unsubscribe link or instructions provided in any email we
send or by contacting us.</p>

<p><strong>Compliance With Laws</strong></p>

<p>We will disclose your Personal Information where required to do so by law or
subpoena or if we believe that such action is necessary to comply with the law
and the reasonable requests of law enforcement or to protect the security or
integrity of our Service.</p>

<p>If Quarter ehf. is involved in a merger, acquisition or asset sale, your
Personal Information may be transferred.</p>

<p><strong>Security</strong></p>

<p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember
that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic
storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to
protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute
security.</p>

<p><strong>International Transfer</strong></p>

<p>Your information, including Personal Information, may be transferred to — and
maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country or
other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ than
those from your jurisdiction.</p>

<p>If you are located outside the EU and choose to provide information to us,
please note that we transfer the information, including Personal Information, to
the EU and process it there.</p>

<p>Your consent to this Privacy Policy followed by your submission of such
information represents your agreement to that transfer.</p>

privacy policies or practices of any third party sites or services.</p>

changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
