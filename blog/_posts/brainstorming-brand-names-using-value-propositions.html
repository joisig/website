    One of the best parts of being an entrepreneur or startup owner is being excited about your business venture. Your business will possess all of your thoughts to the point that most of your daydreams are about details of your business plan, which drinks you’ll offer at your new restaurant or the color of the walls in your high-end salon. This passion and attention to detail are what will eventually turn idea into a fully-fledged business. But all of your cumulative thoughts on your brand may also feel hazy, like they are not tangible yet.
</p>

<p>This could be due to the fact that you’re having difficulty putting into words what your idea for a business is. When people inquire about your business is all about, you suddenly flounder. You bounce from idea to idea but you fail to exactly capture the scope of your future business venture. Afterwards, you get worried that you embarrassed yourself and that no one will take you seriously.
</p>

This concise statement will force you to focus your ideas and boil your business down to its basic elements, which will help you in the process of finding the perfect name for your startup.

</h2>

<p>A value proposition is what conveys the core of your business. You want your specific value proposition to be synonymous with your specific selling proposition, your brand summary, or even your mission and values. While we are fully aware that these concepts vary slightly, this statement is intended to provide a condensed direction. The value proposition needs to inform people what distinctive benefits you will provide to your customers. In addition to being called a value proposition, it is also commonly referred to as an <a target="_blank" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/alejandrocremades/2018/09/08/how-to-prepare-the-perfect-elevator-pitch/">elevator pitch</a>.
</p>

<p>A great example of a value proposition is Domino’s Pizza: “Hot, fresh pizza delivered to your door in 30 minutes or less or it’s free.” Similar to this one, you want a single sentence that is concise and descriptive while demonstrating what makes your business unique.
</p>

<p>If you want to create a solid value proposition very quickly, you can use this helpful formula:
</p>

<blockquote>
    [Great Business Name] helps [audience] [core benefits].
</blockquote>

<p>Creating a value proposition statement like this will also help you fully understand what your business aims to do. It summarizes your long-winded business idea into simple, digestible information.
