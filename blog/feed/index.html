<p>Last Friday, my site StartupResources.io, a collection of categorized tools for Startups, rode the #1 spot all day on Product Hunt. It was a long and glorious day. I wanted to share with everyone how to be #1 on Product Hunt, so that others can be successful too.</p>
<p>But first, here are some of my stats:</p>
<p><strong>Unique visitors</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Friday: 5200 (first day on Product Hunt)</li>
<li>Saturday: 2655</li>
<li>Sunday: 1826</li>
<li>Monday: 3637</li>
<li>Tuesday: 1794</li>
<li>Wednesday: 1006</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mailing list grew from 500 to 1100+ people</strong></p>
<p><strong>Slack group went from 5 to 21 people</strong></p>
<p>I’ve had over 15,000 unique visitors in the last week. Before Product Hunt, the site averaged about 50 people a day.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I use <a href="http://www.dreamhost.com/r.cgi?1524957" target="_blank">Dreamhost</a> and their servers never once seemed to even hiccup when my traffic became 10,000% of the normal amount. I had been concerned about the giant increase in traffic causing issues, but luckily it never seemed to happen.</p>
<p>Anyway, let’s talk about my tactics.</p>
<h2>Tip #1 – Early bird gets first blood</h2>
<p>I live in Nashville, which is the Central time zone in the US. California is two hours behind me. I thought it made sense to get StartupResources.io up on Product Hunt as early as possible, so I set my alarm clock for 3am, so that it could be posted at 1am California time. I knew from research that Friday was the best day to be listed, and I lucked out that nothing else really big was posted that day. The previous day, Product Hunt v2 was posted, and we knew we could not compete with that. I thought I would be pretty brain dead at 3am, so I made a column in my Trello board of what to do to encourage my initial traction on Product Hunt. I had planned to go back to bed at 4am, because starting the work day at 3am is nuts, but things started getting interesting very early, so I made coffee at 5am and pushed on through.</p>
<p>Friday is a great time to get posted because you’ll be able to get more attention over the weekend, when new postings are a little slower.</p>
<h2>Tip #2 – Befriend a hunter</h2>
<p>I’m a big fan of trying to everyone you admire, including bigger names within the Startup / Entrepreneurship world. Accordingly, I’ve buttered up some influencers over the years that I thought might be willing to post this on Product Hunt for me. I made a list of who would perhaps be willing to help, and compared who had the most followers. I weighed my options and decided to ask the great Andrew Warner of Mixergy to post it for me, as we’ve corresponded before and he had something like 1400 followers on Product Hunt. I emailed him and asked. A couple days later he said he’d love to post it. Awesome. I planned with him to do it later that week, and of course I spent the next two days trying to get the site as good looking as possible.</p>
<h2>Tip #3 – Make something the community will want</h2>
<p>I knew Product Hunt was the perfect way to launch because the community would resonate well with a curation site. Obviously my site is similar to Startup Stash, and that’s the most upvoted tech product of all time, so I knew mine could be popular too.</p>
<p>In the comments, someone admitted that they were tired of seeing curation sites like mine, that this type of site has been exhausted. Some jokingly commented that there should be a site that is a curation of all the other curation sites. And of course then two people chimed in and posted actual sites that are curations of curations. So meta.</p>
<h2>Tip #4 – Have prelaunch traction and tell your waiting list</h2>
<p>I put StartupResources.io on BetaList a month ago, as soon as I got the landing page up, and I paid for a rush listing. Totally worth it. It resonated well with that community, and I got around 450 people on my waiting list. I also spent the time before I built the site building up a Twitter following.</p>
<h2>Tip #5 – Use time zones to your advantage</h2>
<p>Since I was listed around 1am California time, I had plenty of hours before Americans would get active on Product Hunt. The evening before my post, I crafted the email I would send to my waiting list, knowing that I might be too brain dead at 3am to not screw something up.</p>
<div id="attachment_123" style="width: 660px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://startupresources.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-13-at-3.51.53-AM1.png"><img class="wp-image-123 size-large" src="http://startupresources.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-13-at-3.51.53-AM1-1024x549.png" alt="" width="650" height="348" srcset="http://startupresources.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-13-at-3.51.53-AM1-1024x549.png 1024w, http://startupresources.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-13-at-3.51.53-AM1-300x161.png 300w, http://startupresources.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Screen-Shot-2015-11-13-at-3.51.53-AM1.png 1440w" sizes="(max-width: 650px) 100vw, 650px" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Screen shot from my Campaign Monitor account. 4am local time, other continents are already awake.</p></div>
<p>Americans were asleep, but people were active in Europe, Australia, Asia and Africa. People were opening the email and following the link to my site, and I started getting upvotes right away.</p>
<p>I had made a list the night before also of Startup buddies overseas to show the listing to, so I emailed them. I also announced it in some Slack groups I’m in, posted on Twitter, Linked In, Facebook groups, wherever I could without being too annoying.</p>
<p>By 9am local time, I had surpassed Pocket’s posting and become #1. It felt awesome.</p>
<h2>Tip #6 – Don’t ask for upvotes</h2>
<p>Daniel from <a href="http://quuu.co" target="_blank">Quuu</a> really drove this home to me when I was talking about my Product Hunt plan: Don’t ask people to upvote it. Just don’t. They have some sort of algorithm that may bust you and penalize you. It’s not worth it. Just show it to everyone and if they will upvote it if they want to. Also, you’ll get a LOT more visitors than you will upvotes. The first day, I had about 10 unique visitors for every 1 upvote on Product Hunt. Upvotes are obviously important, but don’t jeopardize anything by encouraging them.</p>
<h2>Tip #7 – Tell everyone</h2>
<p>This may seem obvious, but tell everyone. This is your potential moment and you have to work it hard to make it happen. Plan out your list of people you need to tell, and make sure you get them all, and as soon as possible after your initial listing. Put it on all your twitter, ask friends to share, ask influencers to share, send it to your cousin, put it on your Facebook, message it to LinkedIn connections, mention it in Slacks, whatever. Get it out there, and as early as possible.</p>
<h2>Tip #8 – Engage in the Product Hunt conversation</h2>
<p>I had read this tip in a couple places, so I made sure to do it. You can be marked as the “Maker” pretty easily once you’re posted, and then you should go in and reply to all comments and ask people what they do and do not like. This can help you get noticed a bit more on Product Hunt, but more importantly, you can use it as an opportunity for customer discovery and improve your product further. The feedback from the conversation can be gold.</p>
<h2>Tip #9 – Fight hard to be #1 so that you can get more attention in the Product Hunt email</h2>
<p>I didn’t even know this would happen, but since I was #1 over the whole weekend, I was at the top of the Product Hunt newsletter that went out Monday. I think this is responsible for the large return of traffic that day. I had more unique visitors on Monday than I did Saturday or Sunday, plus way more engagement, more suggestions and applications to be listed.</p>
<p>Obviously, Product Hunt is a tremendous spike in traffic, and a beautiful growth tool. But it’s unsustainable growth. So&#8230;</p>
<h2>Bonus tip: Make sure you can capitalize on this traffic surge while you have it</h2>
<p>How? Set up social shares to try to encourage Product Hunt visitors to share you on Facebook and Twitter, etc. Capture as many email addresses as you can so that you can market to those people later. Install Facebook retargeting pixels so that you can build a custom audience for ads, and Analytics.</p>
<p>You’ll be glad you did it when the traffic starts to die off, and it will.</p>
<p>Inspired by the success with StartupResources.io on Product Hunt, I am now building pre-launch.io. Get on the wait list at <a href="http://pre-launch.io" target="_blank">pre-launch.io</a></p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>How To Use Twitter To Butter Up Influencers So That They Will Let You Guest Blog</p>
<p>While trying to launch <a href="https://igniteyourmatch.com" target="_blank">Ignite Your Match</a> (a startup that provides critiques of online dating profiles so that they can be improved), I needed to find influencers within the online dating world, and then ask them to allow me to write guest posts on their blogs. I found that Twitter was the easiest way to do this, and after several weeks of “buttering up” influencers, I’m now writing guests posts, and getting published to their audiences. It takes time, and some effort, but it’s fairly straightforward. In this article, I’ll share the tips and tools I use.</p>
<p><strong>Determine your target audience and follow them</strong></p>
<p>This was pretty clear to me when I wanted to promote Ignite Your Match. I wanted to go after people trying (and more importantly having trouble with) online dating. So it made sense to use our <a href="https://twitter.com/igniteyourmatch" target="_blank">@igniteyourmatch</a> Twitter to follow people who gave advice and wrote about online dating. Initial searches for hashtags like #onlinedating and #datingadvice gave me a foundation to build on.</p>
<p>Twitter has a built in tool that makes it easy to find more people to follow once you’ve got your initial base set up. Just look at who it puts into the “Who to follow” section on your sidebar. It will make suggestions based on who you’re already following. I wish it showed the follower count of these suggestions, as that would make it easier to determine the potential influence of each profile. However, a quick click on the account will let you know that.</p>
<p>Another obvious technique is to view the accounts that the influencers follow, and scroll through and follow anyone who seems relevant to your audience. Repeat until you’ve built up a large pool of influencers to follow.</p>
<h2>How to butter up the influencers</h2>
<p>So now you follow a lot of people who are influencers in your field, and perhaps even some have followed you back. You want something from them, namely their audience&#8217;s attention. How do you get it? You ask for it, but first you better butter them up. Once you&#8217;ve established a rapport with them, and they know who you are, you can ask them to let you guest write on their blog, and it&#8217;s likely to happen. It is at least way more likely than a completely cold request.</p>
<p><strong>Favoriting</strong></p>
<p>A mindlessly simple way to get someone to notice you on Twitter is to favorite some of their tweets. That&#8217;s not really doing much for them, however, so you should try&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Retweeting</strong></p>
<p>Retweeting an influencer&#8217;s post or article is a great way for you to help spread their reach and their material. It&#8217;s a quick and easy way to start getting noticed by them.</p>
<p><strong>#FF techniques</strong></p>
<p>On Fridays, do a #FF tweet with the handles of your biggest influencers. Flattery will get you everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Respond to their tweets</strong></p>
<p>If an influencer tweets a question, start a conversation with them. If they post an article, give them your brief thought, or better yet, show them something you wrote on the subject.</p>
<h3><em>Your goal here is to get their attention and have them recognize your name before you reach out to them and ask for anything. Show them value first. </em></h3>
<p><strong>Buffer</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://bufferapp.com" target="_blank">Buffer</a> is a great tool for queuing up retweets, so that you aren&#8217;t having to constantly retweet things, or doing a bunch at once and flooding people&#8217;s timelines. Instead, you can go through your influencers every few days and queue up several days of tweets to get put out a few times a day. Organize influencers into a list on Twitter to make this quicker and easier.</p>
<p><strong>Interact with Twitter chats</strong></p>
<p>I got my best guest writing opportunity after participating in a twitter chat. They would post questions, and I and other experts on online dating would respond. I made my answers funny when appropriate, and afterwards I asked them if I could guest blog on their site, and they immediately said yes.</p>
<h2>How to get onto their blogs</h2>
<p>After you&#8217;ve buttered them up on twitter, simply ask if you can write for their blog. (Make sure you research their blog. Alexa rank can be very telling as to whether their blog is important or influential at all. Don&#8217;t waste your time on a blog with no traffic.) If they follow you on Twitter, then you can DM them, which I find to be a very direct way to ask if you can guest write. Don&#8217;t be too discouraged if they say no. Everyone has their own agenda, and you actively promoting your business with a guest post on their blog might actually conflict with a service they are already offering. If they don&#8217;t follow you on Twitter you can&#8217;t send them a DM, so you should try to find the email address or at least the name of the person you interact with on Twitter, and shoot them an email to ask. After you ask, follow up until you get a definite &#8220;yes&#8221; or a definite &#8220;no.&#8221;</p>
<p>Keep in mind everyone&#8217;s favorite radio station, WII FM, which stands for &#8220;What&#8217;s in it for me?&#8221; Approach the influencer with value. Have a blog topic ready to go, and let them know why it fits in perfectly with their audience. Offer to do a post on your blog about their service too, especially if they are complimentary.</p>

You of course know how everything works, and it all makes sense to you, because you built it. Well designed and easy to use and understand? Obviously, but only to you. You&#8217;re immune to your own usability issues, because you&#8217;re not an end-user. You&#8217;ll need to hire eyes to look at your site and find the usability and conversion issues for you. We all want our websites to convert. Without conversion, you&#8217;ll never have any revenue, and without revenue, you&#8217;ll die. And then you&#8217;ll have to go and get a &#8220;real job&#8221; and no one wants that. So let&#8217;s talk about using surveys to figure out conversion issues, and how to do it cheaply while we&#8217;re at it.

<p>If you&#8217;ve seen any of my articles before, you know I&#8217;m all about Amazon&#8217;s Mechanical Turk system for doing customer discovery and user testing. I wanted to improve conversion on my own startup, Anterose &#8211; Online Dating Profile Critiques, so I ran surveys recently on MTurk and got a lot of actionable items. I used to be a big fan of usertesting.com but once they increased the cost to $49 instead of $29 per test user, I was pretty dismayed, and once I realized they increased the price but hadn&#8217;t started paying testers more, I was done with them. You can use a site like feedbackarmy.com or you can do it yourself with Mechanical Turk and Surveymonkey.</p>
<p>What exactly do you need to ask in your survey? Simply what is keeping people from converting. So you should ask questions about what worries them about your site, and what makes them not trust it, as well as what could be added to make them more likely to order.</p>
<p>Some suggested questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you trust this site? Why or why not?</li>
<li>What would make you trust this site more?</li>
<li>Is it clear what the site offers? Please describe what our service is.</li>
<li>What would keep you from ordering, if you were otherwise interested in our service?</li>
<li>Is there anything lacking from the order page that makes you not trust it?</li>
<li>Does anything confuse you about the check out page?</li>
<li>What makes you trust a site and feel okay about ordering from them?</li>
</ul>
<p>You&#8217;ll be amazed by the responses, and it&#8217;s easy to make actionable lists of changes to implement from the survey responses.</p>
<p>Potential feedback:</p>
<ul>
<li>Learn what confuses people, and what people tend to overlook (people complained I didn&#8217;t have contact information up, but I did)</li>
<li>Learn how to increase user trust by getting an SSL or a Mcafee badge or BBB logo etc</li>
<li>Perhaps people just don&#8217;t quite grasp what your service is, and they leave rather than make the effort to figure it out</li>
<li>People are lazy and they can get confused easily. You can learn what is preventing them from bothering with an order on your site.</li>
<li>By asking general questions about site trust not specific to your own site, you can learn what overall increases user trust.</li>
<li>You probably have too much copy on your site, and they&#8217;ll tell you</li>
<li>Your copy may come off as too dense and hard to process, or perhaps</li>
</ul>
<p>I ran two surveys, one on the index page and one on the checkout page, and got a total of 36 changes to make. The cost was about $30 total. So very worth it.</p>

<div id="attachment_117" style="width: 310px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://startupresources.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fear-sells-advertising-graffiti.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-117" src="http://startupresources.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fear-sells-advertising-graffiti.jpg" alt="Word tell and emotions sell, but fear closes" width="300" height="195" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">Word tell and emotions sell, but fear closes</p></div>
<h2>Why it works</h2>
<p>People are emotional creatures. Last year, I launched <a title="Ignite Your Match" href="https://igniteyourmatch.com" target="_blank">IgniteYourMatch.com</a>, which provides critiques of online dating profiles, and I foolishly had the Field of Dreams syndrome (believing “if you build it, they will come”) and thought people would just order because it’s such a good idea to get men or women to look at your dating profile and tell you how to improve it. I wrote the copy on the index page and explained how it worked. But I wasn’t seeing a lot of conversion. Why not? Because no one was connecting with it. I wasn’t addressing their issues and their fears. I was not giving them an emotional reason to keep going, as they didn’t know I would solve their problems.</p>
<p>The solution was to alter the copy, and to do so I needed to figure out what the biggest concerns about online dating really were. I could address those concerns in the copy, and then people were more likely to order. So I ran surveys on Mechanical Turk and learned the biggest fear with online dating for guys is wasting your time because you’ll never actually have success. <strong>I changed up the site based on my fear research and saw an 800% improvement in traffic to the order page. </strong>(Note, this article refers to the previous version of the site, before a current rebuild).</p>
<p>Customers don’t care about your solution. They care about their own problems. Everybody cares about themselves, and to actually get them to use your service or product, you have to convince them that you have not just a solution, but <em>their solution</em>.</p>
<p>This can work with any business. We’re all trying to sell something to somebody. I have a screen printing business, <a href="http://vacord.com" target="_blank">Vacord Screen Printing</a>, and I wanted to know what people would worry about most when they are trying to order shirts. I simply did some research to figure it out, and learned that a lot of people are worried that they won’t end up getting quality shirts like they imagine, and that the ordering process will be difficult and confusing. Altering the site allows me to address these fears for people, putting them at ease quickly and perhaps subconsciously, which increases the chance they will reach out to us and then convert to a customer.</p>
<p>So do your own research (<a href="https://medium.com/@vacord/why-mechanical-turk-is-the-greatest-market-research-tool-you-never-thought-to-use-872120766ee" target="_blank">here’s a guide on how to run surveys on mechanical turk</a>) and learn:</p>
<ul>
<li>What people are worried about when it comes to using your service</li>
<li>What scares people about the problem you’re trying to solve</li>
<li>What has failed them in the past when they tried to solve the problem</li>
</ul>
<p>Have you had success with fear research? Discuss in the comments.</p>

<p>How do you know that you’re building the right solution to the problem your trying to solve? Furthermore, how do you know that you’re even solving the right problem?</p>
<p><strong>You don’t know.</strong></p>
<p>Unless you do proper Customer Discovery and find out.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customer Discovery is part of the Lean Startup methodology, and encompasses a broad range of techniques to figure out if customers will actually want or care about the product that you’re building. It will steer you to find the right problem to solve, and also allow you to test market desire before you build out the full solution.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">The Customer Discovery process in a nutshell</h2>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"></h3>
<h3 style="text-align: left;">Interviewing</h3>
<p style="text-align: left;">Let’s say that you want to build a startup that helps people in tech find a new job. Your startup isn’t really helping them find a job, but more so helping them solve the problem that finding a job is a challenge. Customer discovery allows you to explore the problem to be solved, which shows you which angle to take as you build your solution.</p>
<p>You must interview potential users and have open and free flowing conversations about their problem. A multiple choice or yes/no survey won’t accomplish this, as it’s necessary to let the conversation flow on its own, which can show you additional problems and nuances that you could solve for the user.</p>
<p>In this example, perhaps you find that, after talking to a lot of potential users, most people looking for jobs struggle with finding the right person to speak to at the target company, and then have trouble keeping track of how often and when to follow up with those people. This could be a totally different solution that you originally wanted to solve, and by speaking to actual people, you learn that this new solution might be a lot more helpful to people, which would improve your chances of a successful startup.</p>
<p>By talking with a lot of potential customers, you either confirm that people want your solution, or learn another solution that would be popular. This prevents you from wasting time, money and energy in building something that people won’t care about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Pre-build validation</h3>
<p>There are several ways to quickly validate a business idea before you actually build the business, and we’ll go over some popular ones below.</p>
<h4>Running ads:</h4>
<p>It takes little time to set up Google or Facebook ads and point them at your target market with your offering and gauge interest by monitoring the click through rate.</p>
<p>The more people click on your ad, obviously the more they are interested in your offering. This is basic market validation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>A smoke test site:</h4>
<p>This involves setting up a site quickly to see if people would be interested in the offering. It’s nothing more than getting a site template, modifying it to talk about your service, and then setting up the “buy now” or “learn more” buttons to track whether people tried to click on them.</p>
<p>You could also use the site to gather email addresses of anyone who tried to order, so that if you do build out the service, you have some pre-launch traction already.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>A MVP or concierge MVP:</h4>
<p>A Minimum Viable Product is the most basic version of your solution. It’s a no-frills version, put up quickly so that people can start using it, which allows you to not only gauge interest but also refine the service based on the initial users.</p>
<p>A concierge MVP is a working service but with no backend built out. This is also known as a “Wizard of Oz” MVP because you’re the guy behind the curtain pulling the strings to make everything happen. Building a working backend can be a very expensive process, but with only a few users, you can probably manually do what will be later heavily automated. This way you can test the business idea before spending a ton.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cold calling:</h4>
<p>While not often considered market validation, cold calling businesses and trying to sell them your service before you create it is a brilliant way to validate your idea, and to learn what all services they would want, what services they don’t care about, and what they would be willing to pay. Are you thinking about starting a service that comes to an office weekly to shred their documents for them, so that they don’t have to fool with it? Call 10 businesses and pitch them. If even one bites on the idea, you’re onto something.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Customer Discovery is a vital process not only in the startup world, but also really with any business. It’s also a way for existing businesses to validate a change in their offering. But ultimately it’s a way to ensure that your business can not only survive, but thrive!</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>What if I told you that for eleven measly dollars you could find out what your target audience wants to read and where they look for articles about that topic? Before I sat down to write this blog post, I spent that much on a club sandwich. And where is that sandwich now? It’s gone, but $11 worth of content marketing research could lead to a long lasting return on investment.</p>
<p>I’m a Mechanical Turk evangelist. I love it for research and for paying a ton of people a dime each to do little bits of work for me. Mechanical Turk, or mTurk for short, is a digital workforce organized and run by Amazon. Most people don’t know about it, and of those who do know of it, most don’t know how to really use it. Unfortunately, it’s not the easiest system to use in the world, but it’s definitely not impossible at all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Who is on mTurk?</h2>
<p>Well, it’s a huge workforce composed of people of various work background, demographics, and hobbies. Some are currently employed or underemployed, and some are in between jobs, or stay at home moms trying to make extra money as they can, et cetera. <em>Mechanical Turk workers, or Turkers, are on average better educated than the general American population. </em>You’d be surprised who you can find on there. I’ve recently run surveys targeting online daters, student pilots, graphic designers, and even startup founders, and had no issue finding people to quickly take a survey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What can you learn from them?</h2>
<p>I founded Vacord Screen Printing, but I also have a couple of startups, including an idea that would train student pilots for the written FAA exams they take in order to get licensed. Not only was I able to use surveys to determine that 75+% of the survey takers want a system like I designed, but they’ll pay handsomely for it. Mechanical Turk is awesome for idea validation like that (<a title="Validate your new business idea for just fifty bucks" href="https://medium.com/@vacord/validate-your-new-business-idea-for-just-fifty-bucks-605eb14bf64d" target="_blank">see my article on validating an idea with mturk</a>), but for content marketing reasons, I also asked the student pilots what confused them most about studying for these exams. I can take their responses and shape my content marketing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ask your target market what they want to learn and:</h2>
<p>-Build an e-book on the topics that interests them and distribute it</p>
<p>-Write blog posts about the topics and then acquire inbound links to the blog</p>
<p>-Say to larger blogs that “80% of your audience wants to learn more about XYZ when surveyed” and get a guest blogging spot to get more traffic to your own site or blog</p>
<p>Perhaps even more brilliant than that, you could go a step further and ask your survey takers not only what they want to read, but where they would go to read it. I did that with the graphic designers, and I found out what they would want to learn about screen printing, and what sites they would visit to try to find these articles. So now I know what they want to read and where to put it so they can find it!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Ask your target market where they go to learn about your topic and:</h2>
<p>-Get lists of sites to try to put your articles on</p>
<p>-Find out what publications they really read and try to get articles or mentions there</p>
<p>-Learn of specific influencers that they respect, and try to coordinate efforts with them</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How do you get the surveys on mTurk?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nitty gritty. I will try to give a thorough but brief overview:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>First, you have to sign up as a “requester” on mTurk.</li>
<li>Fund your account with some money</li>
<li>Design your “HIT” or Human Intelligence Task. You can use the description space to limit who takes your survey (“Moms thinking about returning to the workforce wanted for 7 question survey”)</li>
<li>Determine a price. I pay $0.50 for people to take surveys. (Amazon adds a 10% surcharge, so 20 surveys cost me $11.) I think that’s more than enough. You could pay less, but your HITs will get filled slower, and you might get less quality responses. Also, don’t forget that the Turkers themselves are a very organized workforce, and they’ll review you on their own sites and say whether you’re good to work for or not!</li>
<li>Limit by country. I limit to the United States, but adding Canada too makes sense, and a Turker actually emailed me a couple days asking me to start adding Canada too. But limiting to the USA/Canada will keep people in foreign countries from taking the survey.</li>
<li>Don’t require people be “Masters” to take your HITs. It costs extra and is not at all necessary. Amazon will try to get you to turn it back on. Don’t.</li>
<li>Design your HIT. This is the tricky part, because it’s designed in HTML, and most people aren’t experienced with that. I posted my code I use below.</li>
<li>Make sure you link your HIT to a survey somewhere else. I use SurveyMonkey because I can have a nine question survey for free (see tips section below to see why it’s only nine questions).</li>
<li>Publish and sit back and wait.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is the code that I generally use to create the HIT:</p>
<pre><code>
&lt;h3&gt;Please follow the link for the survey&lt;/h3&gt;
Please feel free to be as long winded and verbose as you want to be in your answers in the survey when there is a comment box! The more we learn, the better we can improve.

This is a survey about being a student pilot or pilot and taking FAA written exams.

The survey consists of just seven questions. Only US citizens should take this survey, as the service will be based on the FAA tests.

&lt;strong&gt;You need to have be involved in aviation to be able to accurately take this survey.&lt;/strong&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/xyzxyzxyz"&gt;Take the survey here&lt;/a&gt; and then enter the code that you receive after finishing the survey into the text box below. Thank you!

&lt;textarea cols="80" name="comment" rows="1"&gt;&lt;/textarea&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Tips for effective surveying</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>How not to get ripped off – I request that the turkers put in a special code after finishing the survey. That way I can tell if they actually finished the survey. Most turkers take it very very seriously, and want to keep their approval rating high, but I have run into a couple jokers (less than .1% of workers, probably). Make your survey two pages, and make the first page all your questions, and the second page a thank you page that has a code, such as “Thank you for taking the survey! Please go put the code word BANANA in the HIT to show you completed it.” You can do a 10 item survey for free on survey monkey, so this lets you have 9 questions and then the 10th item be a second page with the special code.</li>
<li>Keywords are super important to having your survey be able to be found. When I was prototyping my startup Anterose Online Dating Profile Critique, it would take days to get 10 people to review a profile and give feedback on it. Once I added proper keywords, it started taking as little as 45 minutes to fill all the reviews. Huge huge difference there. Most popular keywords that I try to always include would be “fun, easy, english, survey, quick, online, feedback” and so on, and then I add things more relevant to the survey like “graphic design, graphic designer, design, art” and so on.</li>
<li>Encourage people to be verbose in their responses. That makes a difference. Also keep all the answers open ended by having a big comment box for a response, not a rating.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I personally like written surveys, but phone surveys can be even better for in-depth research. <a href="http://customerdiscovery.ninja" target="_blank">Customer Discovery Ninja</a> makes running phone surveys via mTurk a breeze, and includes tools that make the interviewing process easier too. Their system automatically records the call, so you don’t have to worry about taking notes and can just let the conversation unfold.</p>
<p>So that’s my two cents on how you get a ton of inspiration for your content marketing campaign without spending that many cents.</p>
<p>Have any experience with this sort of research? Have questions? Leave a comment below!</p>

<p>Did you get something out of this article? The best way to say “thanks” is to share the article, so please post on your preferred social media outlet.</p>
